# Minigolf - Game "Golf Madness" made with Unity

## About
This project was a part of my bachelor's thesis in computer science. It is a Unity project which I used to create a singleplayer sports video game. Game is called "Golf Madness" and it is set in a 3D environment. 

Minigolf is a core idea behind "Golf Madness". This sport discipline, unlike its parent game, is played on small courses. Systems created for the needs of the implemented application create them procedurally using hybrid approach - a mix of graph theory, wave function collapse, DFS algorithm and Hamiltonian cycles. This method is not so common as one would think in those subgenres of games. Thanks to mentioned track generator, the number of possible tracks is almost infinite, which eliminates the feeling of repetition of consecutive games.

Players move the golf ball using consecutive strikes and overcome various tracks, sometimes filled with obstacles diversifying the gameplay. Many gamemodes and customization options can provide (hopefully) a great dose of fun for every minigolf enjoyer :)
